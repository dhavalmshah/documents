<p>Seema Haider is a Pakistani woman who made headlines in India for her unusual and controversial love story with Sachin Meena, an Indian man she met online. The couple claims to have fallen in love while playing PUBG, a popular online shooting game, in 2019. However, their romance has also raised suspicions of espionage and conspiracy, as Seema allegedly crossed the border illegally and entered India without a visa or citizenship.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-they-meet">How did they meet?</h2>
<p>According to the couple, they started talking while playing PUBG in 2019, and soon developed a romantic relationship. They exchanged phone numbers and social media accounts, and communicated regularly. Seema, who was married and had four children, decided to leave her husband and family in Karachi and elope with Sachin, who lived in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>But their love story was not as simple as it seemed. Seema’s husband, Ghulam Haider, was a former Pakistani army officer who had connections with the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the country’s spy agency¹. He had allegedly married Seema when she was just 15 years old, and had subjected her to domestic violence and abuse². Seema had also filed an affidavit in a Pakistani court, accusing her husband and parents of being greedy and forcing her to marry Ghulam³.</p>
<p>Sachin, on the other hand, was a Hindu man who worked as a software engineer in a multinational company. He had a passion for gaming and music, and had a large following on Instagram and YouTube. He had also participated in several singing competitions and reality shows, and had dreams of becoming a famous singer⁴.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-they-cross-the-border">How did they cross the border?</h2>
<p>Seema and Sachin arranged a secret meeting in Nepal in March 2023, where they got married. Seema travelled from Pakistan to Dubai and then to Nepal, where she met Sachin, who flew from India. They stayed in a hotel in Kathmandu, where they made several Instagram reels with the children of the hotel receptionist. However, they did not register their names or identities in the hotel records, raising doubts about their true intentions.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Seema made a daring move by illegally entering India along with her four children. She disguised herself and her children to resemble rural Indian people, hoping to evade the scrutiny of security agencies. She joined Sachin in his apartment in Greater Noida, where they lived as a married couple. Seema also changed her name and religion, and adopted Sachin’s culture and practices.</p>
<p>But their risky adventure did not go unnoticed. Seema’s husband, Ghulam, had reported her missing to the Pakistani authorities, and had also alerted the ISI about her possible involvement with an Indian man¹. The ISI had traced Seema’s phone calls and social media activities, and had informed the Pakistani High Commission in India about her whereabouts¹. The High Commission had then contacted the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, and had requested for Seema’s deportation¹.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-they-get-caught">How did they get caught?</h2>
<p>Sachin and Seema’s desire to legalise their relationship led to their arrest by the Uttar Pradesh Police on July 4, 2023. A neighbour of Sachin complained to the authorities about the legitimacy of their marriage, and alerted them about Seema’s Pakistani origin. The police raided their apartment and found Seema and her children without any valid documents or identification. Sachin and his father were also arrested for assisting and sheltering an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>The couple’s arrest sparked a media frenzy and a national security investigation. Many have dubbed Seema’s move as a conspiracy by Pakistan to release a spy in India, and have questioned her motives and background. Some have also accused Sachin of being a traitor and a collaborator with the enemy. The police and the intelligence agencies are probing the couple’s activities, contacts, and communication records, and are trying to verify their claims and stories.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-allegations-against-them">What are the allegations against them?</h2>
<p>The main allegation against Seema is that she is a Pakistani spy who was sent to India to gather sensitive information and sabotage the country’s security. The police have claimed that Seema had access to Sachin’s laptop and phone, which contained confidential data and documents related to his company and projects⁴. They have also alleged that Seema had contacted several Pakistani numbers and accounts from Sachin’s devices, and had shared classified information with them⁴.</p>
<p>The police have also accused Sachin of being a part of the spy network, and of helping Seema in her mission. They have alleged that Sachin had provided Seema with fake identity cards and documents, and had helped her cross the border and evade the authorities⁴. They have also alleged that Sachin had received money from Pakistani sources, and had used it to fund Seema’s travel and expenses⁴.</p>
<p>The couple has denied all the allegations, and has maintained that they are innocent and in love. They have claimed that they have no links with any spy agency or terrorist group, and that they have never harmed or betrayed India. They have also claimed that they have faced threats and harassment from both sides of the border, and that they have been framed by their enemies.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-their-current-status">What is their current status?</h2>
<p>The couple was released on bail on July 7, 2023, after a UP court granted them relief. They hugged each other outside the jail, and expressed their love and commitment. However, the court has imposed some conditions on Seema - she has been asked to not change her residence till the case is ongoing, and to mark her presence before the court regularly. Seema has also claimed that she would not be safe in Pakistan, and has requested asylum in India. Sachin has vowed to stand by her, and has said that he will fight for their rights and happiness.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-future-of-their-relationship">What is the future of their relationship?</h2>
<p>The Seema Haider story is a complex and controversial one, that has captured the attention and imagination of many. It is a tale of love and betrayal, of hope and fear, of passion and politics. It is also a test of the relations between India and Pakistan, two neighbouring countries that have a history of conflict and hostility. The fate of the couple and their children depends on the outcome of the legal and diplomatic processes, and the public opinion. Will they be able to overcome the obstacles and challenges, and live together peacefully? Or will they be separated and punished for their actions? Only time will tell.</p>
